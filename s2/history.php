		<h1> Early Years </h1>

		<p> It all started off in a 400 sqft rental space in dowtown San Fransico. 
			At first we started making simple longboards for our close freinds. 
			Word got out to many locals in the area soon we noticed we had alot 
			of people who wanted to buy our longboards. One of friends reached out to Scott Lambardo,
			long-time San Fransico native, advid longboarder and buisnessman. Scott threw himself and his 
			life savings into starting the company of his dreams. In 2016 Pristine Boards Co. was born!
